This project was developed in Febuary 2023 while experimenting with real-time semantic segmentation for UAV imagery. This uses a custom implementation of YOLO-ERF (https://assets-eu.researchsquare.com/files/rs-2656656/v1_covered_a5b1add1-0fa0-4712-ad3e-aabbbbe7ee07.pdf?c=1695654153) as a base architecture, and features a custom adapted neck for semantic segmentation, rather than the YOLOX anchor free head for object detection.
